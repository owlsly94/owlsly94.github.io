For me, it happened by accident during my school practice at an electrotechnical high school. While some of my peers were heading to big public firms like Telekom, I ended up at a small, private PC service shop. That’s where I saw it: a system that looked &ldquo;weird,&rdquo; fast, and undeniably cool.</p><h2 id=the-catalyst-ubuntu-910>The Catalyst: Ubuntu 9.10</h2><p>At the time, I was rocking an Asus K70. It was a decent machine, but Windows 7 felt like it was running through mud. After peppering the tech at the shop with a thousand questions, we took the plunge and installed Ubuntu 9.10 &ldquo;Karmic Koala.&rdquo;</p><p>The difference was night and day. But more than the speed, it was the curiosity that got me. I started devouring documentation, lurking on forums, and following the first wave of Linux YouTubers. I was officially down the rabbit hole.</p><h2 id=the-evolution-arch-gentoo-and-the-rabbit-hole>The Evolution: Arch, Gentoo, and the &ldquo;Rabbit Hole&rdquo;</h2><p>Once you learn that you don&rsquo;t have to accept the defaults, you start looking for more control. My journey followed the path of many enthusiasts:</p><ul><li><strong>The Learning Phase:</strong> Getting comfortable with the command line and understanding how a kernel actually talks to hardware.</li><li><strong>The Arch Phase:</strong> Distro-hopping eventually led me to Arch. I wanted to build my system piece by piece, and the &ldquo;Arch Way&rdquo; taught me more about Linux than any textbook ever could.</li><li><strong>The Ultimate Challenge:</strong> Then came Gentoo. People talk about it like it’s an impossible mountain, but once you understand the documentation, it’s actually quite logical. Compiling from source gave me that &ldquo;full control&rdquo; feeling I’d been craving.</li></ul><h2 id=the-final-barrier-gaming>The Final Barrier: Gaming</h2><p>For years, I lived a double life. My laptops were pure Linux, but my main desktop stayed on Windows. Why? Gaming. I loved the freedom of Linux, but I wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up my library. For a long time, it felt like a compromise I’d always have to make.</p><p>Then, Valve released <strong>Proton</strong>. Suddenly, the &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; was possible. The performance gap closed, the compatibility skyrocketed, and I finally did it: I ditched Windows completely.</p><h2 id=why-linux>Why Linux?</h2><p>People often ask why I bother. The answer is simple: <strong>Freedom.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Customization:</strong> You can make it look like a futuristic HUD or a brutalist terminal.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> It can be as bloated or as minimal as you want.</li><li><strong>Ownership:</strong> You are in full control of your hardware. No forced updates, no telemetry you can&rsquo;t turn off, just you and your machine.</li></ul><p>Today, almost every system in my house runs Linux. Looking back at that kid in the repair shop, I don&rsquo;t think he realized that a simple OS install would turn into a lifelong passion for open-source sovereignty.</p></div></article><div class=comments style=margin-top:50px><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=owlsly94/owlsly94.github.io issue-term=pathname label=comments theme=dark-blue crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></main><footer class=site-footer><hr class=footer-divider><div class=footer-container><p class=copyright>&copy; 2026 owlsly</p><div class=footer-socials><a href=https://github.com/owlsly94 target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label=GitHub>github</a>
