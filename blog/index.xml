&lt;p&gt;If you’ve spent years on Windows, you’ve been taught that &amp;ldquo;gaming on Linux&amp;rdquo; is either a myth or a headache. But for those of us who grew up tinkering from our young days to the depths of the Arch Wiki, we know the truth. On Arch, you don&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; games&amp;hellip; You optimize the entire environment for them.&lt;/p&gt;

While some of my peers were heading to big public firms like Telekom, I ended up at a small, private PC service shop. That’s where I saw it: a system that looked &amp;ldquo;weird,&amp;rdquo; fast, and undeniably cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was rocking an Asus K70. It was a decent machine, but Windows 7 felt like it was running through mud. After peppering the tech at the shop with a thousand questions, we took the plunge and installed Ubuntu 9.10 &amp;ldquo;Karmic Koala.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
